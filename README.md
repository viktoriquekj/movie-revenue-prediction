# Movie Revenue Prediction (TMDB Data)

A complete, end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts **movie box-office revenue before release** using TMDB metadata, engineered features, and a stacked ensemble model.

**Note:** This project uses the TMDB API but is **not endorsed or certified** by TMDB.

---

## Project Overview

Studios and streamers rely on early revenue forecasts to drive:

- P&A (Print & Advertising) allocation  
- Greenlighting and ROI decisions  
- Slate planning and scenario modeling  

This project builds a **reproducible forecasting system** that predicts **log(revenue)** using pre-release attributes (budget, cast, genres, dates, certifications, etc.).

The pipeline includes:

- TMDB API ingestion  
- Time-aware feature engineering  
- Multiple ML baselines (ElasticNet, RF, XGBoost, NN)  
- Final **stacked ensemble (Model C)**  
- Deployment workflow for **upcoming 2025 releases**  
- SHAP-based feature importance analysis  

For business framing and architecture:
- `docs/business_context.md`  
- `docs/architecture.md`  
- `docs/conclusions.md` (dashboard-style)

## Feature Engineering

Key engineered features include:

- **Log-budget**, runtime, collection/franchise flag  
- **Historical priors** for directors, lead cast, composers  
- **Multi-hot encodings**: genres, keywords, production countries  
- **Cyclical temporal features**: month, weekday, release season  
- **Leakage-free chronological splits (2017–2024)**  
- **Winsorization + imputers** for robust model input  

Feature generation is implemented in:
`src/movie_revenue_prediction/features/build_features.py`

---

## Models

- **ElasticNet**  
- **RandomForest**  
- **XGBoost**  
- **MLP Neural Network (with SWA)**  
- **Stacked Ensemble (Model C)** ← **Final production model**

Artifacts stored in:  
`artifacts/ensemble_C/` 

Evaluation metrics stored in:  
`results/metrics/`

---

## Deployment (2025 Forecast Demo)

Predict revenue for unreleased 2025 movies:

```python
from movie_revenue_prediction.deployment.pipeline import predict_with_model_C

df = predict_with_model_C("data/curated/tmdb_2025.csv")
``` 

Output saved to:
`results/final_results/df_2025_predictions.csv`

Notebook demo:
`notebooks/02_deployment_2025_demo.ipynb`

## Dashboard (Coming Soon)

An interactive dashboard (Tableau or Power BI) will include:

### Page 1 — EDA on Historical Dataset
- Revenue distribution  
- Genre, certification, and language breakdowns  
- Budget vs revenue relationships  
- Seasonal and calendar-based insights  

### Page 2 — Prediction Analysis
- Predicted vs actual revenue (log-scale and raw scale)  
- Residual distributions and error diagnostics  
- RMSE by year  
- Feature importance (SHAP)  
- Distribution of 2025 revenue forecasts  

Dashboard link: [to be added]

## Environment Notes (SHAP Requires a Separate Environment)

Most of the project (training, feature engineering, evaluation, deployment) runs in the main environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
``` 

However, the notebook `03_shap_feature_analysis.ipynb` uses SHAP, which requires:

- numpy >= 2

- avoiding TensorFlow and XGBoost due to binary incompatibilities on macOS

To run SHAP, create a dedicated lightweight environment: 

```bash
conda create -n movie_shap_env python=3.11 -y
conda activate movie_shap_env

pip install "numpy>=2"
pip install shap>=0.50
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib joblib

``` 
Use this environment only for interpretability work. 

## Key Conclusions (Short Version)

- Budget, franchise status, and runtime are the strongest predictors of movie revenue, based on SHAP feature importance analysis.

- Temporal features such as month and weekday meaningfully capture release-strategy effects.

- Ensemble Model C explains approximately 86% of the variance in 2024 revenue and reduces error by over 60% compared to a naive baseline.

- Performance remains stable when applied to 2025 forward predictions, though results should be interpreted carefully because 2025 revenues are incomplete.

Full conclusions are available in:
`docs/conclusions.md`

## Installation 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

Example import:

```python
from movie_revenue_prediction.features.build_features import make_features_timeaware_splits
```
